# SONIC-1-IN-SONIC-3-S.C.E.-

![Title](https://i.imgur.com/VbQoOjT.png)

## Disclaimer

Source code with the Sonic 2 Clone Driver v2 (Mega PCM 2.0 version). Unstable version. I haven't tested how well the game works with this sound driver. You can use this version of the source code, but it's not recommended.
Clone driver works poorly and is slow. The music from S3K sounds weird. I just recommend continuing to use the S3K Z80 driver.

This is a port of Sonic The Hedgehog (1991) to Sonic Clean Engine (S.C.E.), our heavily modified and improved Sonic 3 & Knuckles engine, which we have been using for a long time for our MD projects (such as Hellfire Saga and Sonic 3 & Knuckles: Epilogue).

Free use. You use it at your own risk. All code is provided “as is”. This source code uses software from other authors. Check their licenses before using it. You assume any and all responsibility for using this content responsibly. I claims no responsibility or warranty.

You can use this source code as a base for your projects, or just as an example for optimizations of your source code.

#### Main source code:

- [Sonic-Clean-Engine-S.C.E.-](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-Clean-Engine-S.C.E.-)

## How to build the ROM

To build this, use Build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.lua otherwise. The built ROM will be called 'Sonic.gen'.

## Quick start

- For editing sprites you can use [SonMapEd](https://info.sonicretro.org/SonMapEd), [ClownMapEd](https://info.sonicretro.org/ClownMapEd) or [Flex2](https://info.sonicretro.org/Flex_2) (Read the issues).

- For editing levels you can use official [SonLVL](https://info.sonicretro.org/SonLVL) or [SonLVL-64x64-Compatible](https://github.com/Project1114/SonLVL-64x64-Compatible). Unfortunately, [SonED2](https://info.sonicretro.org/SonED2) is no longer supported.

- To convert SMPS music to asm format you can use [smps2asm](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/smps2asm-and-improved-s-k-driver.26876).

## Current issues

1. S.C.E. uses [Kosinski Plus algorithm](https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp/blob/master/src/asm/KosinskiPlus.asm), but **Flex2** program does not support **Kosinski Plus Module**. Therefore, **Flex2.json** project file is partially useless. **SonMapEd** program does not support **Kosinski Plus** at all. You can only open uncompressed graphics.

#### Alternative programs:
- [mdcomp](https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp/releases)
- [ClownMapEd](https://github.com/Clownacy/ClownMapEd/releases)
- [FW-KENSC-ShellExt](https://github.com/MainMemory/FW-KENSC-ShellExt/releases)

## FAQ

- If you want to convert levels from previous Sonic games, you have to use [LevelConverter](https://info.sonicretro.org/LevelConverter) from [SonLVL](https://info.sonicretro.org/SonLVL). Then change the layout format using [Layout converter](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-/tree/Clone-Driver-v2/Levels/_tools/Layout).

- If you want to make a different text for Title Card, you need to create a file of letters from [List.unc](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-/tree/Clone-Driver-v2/Objects/Title%20Card/KosinskiPM%20Art/Levels). This will be loaded before the level starts.
You don't have to add the letters **'ENOZ' (ZONE)** because those letters are already in VRAM. Then you have to create a mapping of your zone name in [Map - Title Card.asm](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-/tree/Clone-Driver-v2/Objects/Title%20Card/Object%20Data).

- If you want to use other SMPS music you can use [Valley Bell's SMPS Research](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/valley-bells-smps-research.32473) or [vgm2smps](https://github.com/Ivan-YO/vgm2smps/releases).
